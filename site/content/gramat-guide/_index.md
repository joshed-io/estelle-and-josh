Feel free to dress more casually than for Saturday if you'd like. It might be hot.
This day starts earlier and goes longer. Please prioritize your comfort.

The ceremony will be officiated by our dear friend <br> **Julian Nachtigal**.

The ceremony will take place on land, not that it matters to Julian, who is equally capable of such feats at sea.
